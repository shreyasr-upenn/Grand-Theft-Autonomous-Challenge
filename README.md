# MEAM 510 - Grand Theft Autonomous Challenge

The overall approach for this project was to enable autonomous functionality for each part of the game using a simple web interface with commands such as “find and reach the police car”, “find and reach the trophy” (or fake), “move to (x,y)” and “follow the wall”, for testing manual movement functions and an emergency stop buttons were implemented as well. For simplicity, the robot featured two wheel drive with a caster in the front and was powered by a 7.4V Li-ion battery and controlled by an ESP32-S2 microcontroller.
